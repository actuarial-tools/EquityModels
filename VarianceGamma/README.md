Variance Gamma
============

A plugin which implements the Variance Gamma equity model for calibration and simulation.

The Variance Gamma (VG) is a  mathematical model for simulating stock prices and allows closed form 
calculation of European options, one popular financial derivative product. 
The model is both simple and robust at the same time and is a very good 
alternation to the existing models like Heston stochastic volatility model 
and Black-Scholes Model which may be biased when applied to real market 
circumstance.

This plug-is has been developed starting from the University of Edinburgh MSC in 
finance and operation research dissertation of Safe Khampol. The aim of the 
dissertation was to implement a calibration and Monte Carlo simulation procedure
for The Variance Gamma (VG) Model for Matlab and for the Fairmat plug-in system.

Once installed the plug-in offers the possibility of using a new process, the Variance Gamma process and to calibrate them.
